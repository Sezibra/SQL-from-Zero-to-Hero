# CREATING TABLES IS MOSTLY THE FIRST STEP:

[be sure that you have a solid understanding of different data types]
INT --> Whole numbers
DECIMAL (M,N) --> Decimal numbers, exact values
VARCHAR (100) --> String of text of length 100
BLOB --> Binary large object, stores large data
Date --> 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTRAMP --> 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' [only if you deal with the recordings]

!!! The basic query for creating tables.
CREATE TABLE employers (
    employer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR (30) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR (20) DEFAULT 'unknown',
    PRIMARY KEY (employer_id)
);
DESCRIBE employers; [double check your query!]
DROP TABLE emploers; [in case you want to delete your table]

ALTER TABLE employers ADD salary DECIMAL (3,3); [in case you want to add an extra column]
ALTER TABLE employers DROP COLUMN department; [in case you want to drop a column]

# INSERTING DATA INTO YOUR TABLES IS AN IMPORTANT PROCESS:

INSERT INTO employers VALUES (1, 'Hannah', 'IT');
INSERT INTO employers (employer_id, name) VALUES (1, 'Hannah'); [in case any information is missing]

# UPDATING AND DELETING DATA:

UPDATE employers
SET department = 'HR'
WHERE department = 'Human R.' OR 'H. Ressources';

DELETE FROM employers
WHERE employer_id = 35067;

# GETTING INFORMATIONS FROM DATABASES:

SELECT *
FROM employers;
WHERE employee_salary > 3500
ORDER BY department DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT DISTINCT department 
FROM employers;

# IN CASE IT IS NEEDED TO CREATE A DATABESE:

CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR (30),
last_name VARCHAR (30),
birthday DATE,
sex VARCHAR (1),
salary INT,
manager_id INT,
department_id INT
); 
[If you create many tables, 
the following tables should also contain a FOREIGN KEY and REFERENCES]
such as...

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
REFERENCES branch (branch_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY (super_id)
REFERENCES employer (employer_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

# USEFUL FUNCTIONS:

SELECT COUNT (employer_id)  [to count any item in the database]
FROM employers;

SELECT AVG (salary)   [to deal with the average]
FROM employee
WHERE sex = 'Female';
OR
GROUP by sex;

# % , # , _ CHARACTERS:

SELECT *
FROM department
WHERE employer_name LIKE '%ab%';
OR
WHERE birth_date LIKE '____-02%' [whoever born in February]

# UNION OPERATOR: [to combine rows from different tables]

SELECT first_name AS name
FROM employers;
UNION
SELECT department 
FROM branch;

SELECT salary
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT total_sales
FROM works_with;

# JOIN OPERATOR: [to combine columns from different tables]

SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    e.department,
    b.branch
FROM employee e
JOIN branch b
    ON e.employee_id = b.emp_id;

# NESTED QUERIES: [sql begins from the inner query to outer one]

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM employee e
WHERE e.employee_id IN (
    SELECT ww.employee_id
    FROM works_with ww
    WHERE ww.total_sales > 30000
);

# DELETING ENTRIES:

CREATE TABLE branch (
branch_id INt PRIMARY KEY,
branch_name VARCHAR (40),
manager_id INT,
manager_start_date DATE,
FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employee (employee_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

[so if you go delete employee id SQL set manager_id instead of NULL, as follows]
DELETE FROM employee_id = 102
WHERE employee_id; 

# USING TRIGGERS: [configuring an automated action]

DELIMITER $$
CREATE
    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
    ON employee
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
        INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES ('added new employee');
    END $$
DELIMITER; 

[it would look like as follows with conditionals]
DELIMITER $$
CREATE
    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
    ON employee
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
        IF NEW.sex = 'M' THEN
              INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES ('added new employee');
        ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN
              INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES ('added female');
        ELSE
              INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES ('added male');   
        END IF;
    END $$
DELIMITER;
