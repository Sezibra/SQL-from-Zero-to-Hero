CREATING TABLES IS MOST OF THE TIME THE FIRST STEP:

INT --> Whole numbers
DECIMAL (M,N) --> Decimal numbers, exact values
VARCHAR (1) --> String of text of length 1
BLOB --> Binary large object, stores large data
Date --> 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTRAMP --> 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' *only if you deal with the recordings



A SUPER BASIC QUERY WHICH IS ALWAYS IN USE:

SELECT employee_name, employee_id;
FROM employee
WHERE employee_salary > 3000;
