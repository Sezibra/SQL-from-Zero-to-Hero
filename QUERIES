# CREATING TABLES IS MOSTLY THE FIRST STEP:

*be sure that you have a solid understanding of different data types.
INT --> Whole numbers
DECIMAL (M,N) --> Decimal numbers, exact values
VARCHAR (100) --> String of text of length 100
BLOB --> Binary large object, stores large data
Date --> 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTRAMP --> 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' *only if you deal with the recordings

*The basic query for creating tables.
CREATE TABLE employers (
    employer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR (30),
    department VARCHAR (20),
    PRIMARY KEY (employer_id)
);
DESCRIBE employers; *double check your query!
DROP TABLE emploers; *in case you want to delete your table...

ALTER TABLE employers ADD salary DECIMAL (3,3); *in case you want to add an extra column...
ALTER TABLE employers DROP COLUMN department; *in case you want to drop a column...



# A SUPER BASIC QUERY WHICH IS ALWAYS IN USE:

SELECT employee_name, employee_id;
FROM employee
WHERE employee_salary > 3000;
